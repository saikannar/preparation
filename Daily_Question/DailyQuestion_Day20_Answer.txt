Answers for yesterday’s daily question
1) Given that you have 250 test cases but you do not want to run 150 of  them unless the other 100 is successful . How do you achieve them in testng?
Make first 100 test cases as a single group [example: @test(groups={"smoke"})], then make next  150 test cases another group [example: : @test(groups={"sanity"})] and also make it depends on previous group (example: [@test(groups="sanity", dependsongroups ="smoke")].
This will force testcases 101 - 250 to run only after first 100 test cases run successfully.

2)Is it possible to run testcases in dataprovider in parallel for each test data given? If yes ,how to do that? ? If no , why can’t it be done?

Data providers can run in parallel with the attribute parallel:

@dataprovider(parallel = true)

Parallel data providers running from an xml file share the same pool of threads, which has a size of 10 by default. 

You can modify this value in the <suite> tag of your xml file:

<suite name="suite1" data-provider-thread-count="20" >

If you want to run a few specific data providers in a different thread pool, you need to run them from a different xml file.
