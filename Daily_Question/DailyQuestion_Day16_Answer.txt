1)Consider one div having 100 spans with uniaue text. How to find expected text using XPath?
     <html>
	
<body>
		
<div>
			
<span>text1</span>
			
<span>text2</span>
			
<span>text3</span>
					
-
					
-
			
<span>text100</span>
		
</div>
	
</body>

</html>	

  
Text(): In this expression, with text function, we find the element with exact text match as shown above. In our case, we find the element with text "text3".

Xpath=//span[text()='text3']



2)how would you handle exception in your project specially when element is not found , not visible and when browser suddently closed?



We handle such conditions and then prints a user friendly warning message to user through try/catch.
Example:
	
     try {

	driver.findElement(By.name(nameValue)).clear();
			
        driver.findElement(By.name(nameValue)).sendKeys(data);	
			        System.out.println("The data: "+data+" entered successfully in field :");
			        bReturn = true;

	
	} 
    catch (NoSuchElementException e) {
			
        System.out.println("The Element not found");
		
        } 
    catch (ElementNotVisibleException e) {
	
	System.out.println("The Element not Visible");
		
        } 
    catch (NoSuchSessionException e) {
			
        System.out.println("The Browser is closed");
		
        }
