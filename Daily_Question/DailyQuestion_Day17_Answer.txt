Answer for Question
1)What is the use of <package> tag in TestNG xml ?

In testng.xml file we can specify the specific package name , which needs to be executed.
In a project there may be many packages, but we want to execute only the selected packages.
We need to specify the names of the packages in between the package tags.
Example:
<!DOCTYPE suite SYSTEM "http://testng.org/testng-1.0.dtd" >
 
<suite name="Suite1" verbose="5" >
  <test name="Regression1"   >
    <packages>
      <package name="test.sample" />
   </packages>
 </test>
</suite>
TestNG will look at all the classes in the package test.sample and will retain only classes that have TestNG annotations.

2)How to run method in paraller using TestNG xml from single class file?


The method can be run in paraller using Method groups.You can also exclude or include individual methods:
<suite name="My suite" parallel="methods" thread-count="2">
<test name="Test1">
  <classes>
    <class name="example1.Test1">
      <methods>
        <include name="TestMethod1"/>
        <include name="TestMethod2"/>
      </methods>
     </class>
  </classes>
</test>

TestNG will run all your test methods in separate threads. Dependent methods will also run in separate threads but they will respect the order that you specified.
