2)What Is Constructor In Java? Does Java Support Distructor?

A Constructor Does Look Like A Method, But It's Not A Method. It's Got The Code That Runs When You Say New. The Code Will Runs When You Instantiate An Object. The Only Way To Invoke A Constructor Is With The Keyword New Followed By The Class Name, Every Class You Create Has Constructor, Even If You Don’t Write It Self

No Java Don’t Have Destructor, Because Java Is A Garbage Collected Language You Cannot Predict When (Or Even If) An Object Will Be Destroyed. Hence There Is No Direct Equivalent Of A Destructor. There Is An Inherited Method Called Finalize , But This Is Called Entirely At The Discretion Of The Garbage Collector.
